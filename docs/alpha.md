```

### 3. Performance and Reliability
```bash
insights add "alpha-feedback" "performance-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" "System performance observations" "Search speed: [rating]. Memory usage: [observations]. Crashes or errors: [describe]. System specs: [brief description]"
```

### 4. Enterprise Needs
```bash
insights add "alpha-feedback" "enterprise-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" "Enterprise requirements" "Team size: X. Key requirements: [list]. Security concerns: [list]. Deployment preferences: [describe]. Budget considerations: [rough range]"
