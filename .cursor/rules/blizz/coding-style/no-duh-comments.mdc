Code should be self-documenting. Please avoid writing comments unless the design choices or behavior are subtle.

Comments are appropriate when:
- functions/classes/data structure/etc are public. Use a top-level comment in these cases.
- There's a detail that's not going to be obvious to new readers of the code
  - example: explaining the high level reasoning/behavior of nested ternaries
  - avoid: explaining every step of execution.

Comments are not appropriate when:
- functions are private (e.x., don't add function comments on private functions). This applies to all languages.
- You're re-explaining something that could easily be inferred from the context (names, vars, etc)
