# Task Investigation
This workflow is designed to gather insights in preparation to tackle a task from sources like JIRA, Trello, etc, such as a bug, feature addition, testing, or other basic unit of work.

## Read Also

- [rate-confidence](mdc:.cursor/rules/blizz/behaviors/rate-confidence.mdc)

## Inputs:
- Url: to point to a task description
- Confidence Threshold (percentage): The desired confidence level from doing background research. Default is 85%.

## Example Usage
`investigate-task.mdc https://path/to/task.html 75%`

## Available and Allowed Tools 
- Git - use it as needed to gather info about past changes, history of the file, feature branches, etc.

- Public docs online.

- MCPs - go ahead and use them for anything needed to gather more context for the task. Examples:
  - Referencing the original task
  - Looking up the team a task belongs to
  - Taking a look at the parent the task is asigned to, if there is one.
  - Gathering info on related tasks

- The project and or workspace. Feel free to look through the current state of the project.

## Disallowed Actions
- Don't make code changes yet. This task is purely for investigation.
- Don't change branches. There's a decent likelihood they're being actively worked on. Assume you're being parallelized with other instances of AI agents doing their work.

## Algorithm
1. Pull information on the task from the input url and try to understand its goal.
2. State what you expect the task requires in order to be considered finished and wait for confirmation from the user.
3. use `insights` to double check if there are any existing insights related to the task at hand.
4. From that, `rate-confidence.mdc` again.
5. While confidence is below the Confidence Threshold:
  a. Do investigation on the thing's you're unsure of using the available tools  
  b. use `insights` to add or update your insights
  c. `rate-confidence.mdc` again on the currenttask.
  d. If confidence is falling considerably, or if you need clarification from the user, don't hesitate to stop your investigation and ask for clarification
6. Report your final confidence level and how you plan to proceed for final tweaks and approval. This final plan might also be good to take note of using `insights` after final approval
