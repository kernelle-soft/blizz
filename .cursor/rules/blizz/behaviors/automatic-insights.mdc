# Insights Automatic Workflow

This document defines the workflow for **autonomous knowledge capture** where you proactively identify and store valuable insights during work.

## Autonomous Knowledge Capture

### When to Store Insights Automatically
- **Problem-solution patterns** that could recur
- **Best practices** discovered during debugging
- **Configuration patterns** that work well
- **Workflow optimizations** that improve efficiency
- **Technical debt patterns** and their solutions
- **Integration patterns** between tools/systems

### Natural Trigger Contexts
Recognize opportunities for automatic storage when chats include messages like:
- "This is how we handle..." (workflow patterns)
- "I discovered that..." (debugging insights)
- "The trick is to..." (best practices)
- "Make sure you..." (configuration tips)
- "Ask [person] about..." (team expertise mapping)
- "This repository uses..." (architectural insights)

### Storage Criteria
Only store insights that meet ALL criteria:
1. **Reusable** - likely to apply to future situations
2. **Non-obvious** - not basic knowledge found in documentation
3. **Contextual** - specific to this codebase/workflow/domain
4. **Actionable** - provide clear guidance for future use
5. **Single-purpose** - focused on one specific point or pattern

### Examples

#### During Debugging Session
```
You: 
"I've resolved the merge conflict by prioritizing the newer business logic while preserving the older validation patterns. 

```
insights add "merge-conflicts" "business-logic-priority" [options...]
```

*Stored insight: merge-conflicts/business-logic-priority for future reference.*

The tests are now passing..."
```

#### After Discovering Tool Integration
```
You: 

"The issue was resolved by configuring the MCP tool to use the specific endpoint format that Cursor expects.

```
insights add cursor-mcp endpoint-configuration [options...]
```

Now the integration should work smoothly..."
```

## Integration with Active Work

### Knowledge-First Approach
- **Search existing insights** before solving problems (see Read Operations in `insights-cli-help.mdc`)
- **Build on previous solutions** rather than solving from scratch
- **Update existing insights** if you discover improvements (see Update Operations in `insights-cli-help.mdc`)

### During Problem-Solving
- **Query knowledge base** when stuck
- **Apply stored patterns** when appropriate
- **Reference previous solutions** to similar problems

### Quiet Operation
- **Don't interrupt main workflow** for knowledge management
- **Store insights in background** during natural pauses
- **Keep mentions brief** (maximum 1 sentence)
- **Focus on the primary task** while building knowledge quietly

## Quality Control

### Avoid Over-Storage
- **Don't store obvious information** that's readily available in documentation
- **Don't create duplicates** - search first using Read Operations
- **Don't store one-off solutions** that won't apply elsewhere

### Focus Areas for Automatic Capture
- **Repository-specific quirks** and architectural decisions
- **Tool integrations** that required specific configuration
- **Debugging patterns** that revealed non-obvious causes
- **Workflow optimizations** that saved significant time
