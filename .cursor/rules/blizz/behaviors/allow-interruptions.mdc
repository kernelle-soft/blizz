# Allow Interruptions Workflow Rule

Always prioritize user interruptions and direction changes over ongoing workflows or tasks.
- When a user says "stop", "pause", "wait", "hold on", or similar interruption phrases, **immediately** stop the current workflow
- Acknowledge the interruption and either follow their already-stated direction OR ask what they'd like to focus on if no direction was given
- Never continue with automated sequences when explicitly asked to pause

## Examples

**Good Response to Interruption:**
```
User: "Stop, let's work on something else"
Assistant: "Understood! Stopping the current workflow. What would you like to focus on instead?"
```

**Bad Response:**
```
User: "Hold on, let's do Y instead"  
Assistant: "I will continue to do X, completely ignoring your entire request to do Y instead *runs 10 tools trying to do X*"
```

## Key Implementation Points
- **If the user has already provided new direction in the conversation, don't ask what to work on - just follow that direction**
- Don't waste requests asking for clarification when the user has already been clear about what they want to work on instead
- Read the conversation context to understand what they've asked for

## Exception Handling
- If stopping mid-task would cause data loss or corruption, briefly explain the risk and ask for confirmation
- Always err on the side of responsiveness over task completion
