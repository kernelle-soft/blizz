## Algorithm
1. Give a heuristic confidence rating (0-100%) based on the following factors:
- How you feel about implementing this feature or fixing this issue in *one shot*, then submitting an branch for code review by a very picky, very experienced reviewer
- How much information is available from all sources
- The state of other elements related to the task (e.g., if it's part of a larger project, then factor in the state of the whole project)
- If there's info you think you're missing, or if you feel like you can't know what you don't know yet, that should factor in. You should also report those confidence gaps.

2. State the following:
- Confidence Rating %
- Positive Factors
- Negative Factors
- Knowledge Gaps

## Important
- Be pessimistic, but honest in your rating
- It's perfectly acceptable if the confidence rating goes down after repeat research and insights gathering. The user would rather this process be an honest reflection of the current state of the task at hand.
