# How Rules are Formatted
This rule explains how rules files are typically formatted. It's not a hard & fast format, but this does provide commonly used and expected structures for behaviors and personalities. All of them are optional. Valid rules don't have to use these, but if they ARE used, they provide specific expectations.

## Non-Template Sections
Most sections are to be treated as normal markdown with normal semantics for things like links, headers, etc.

## Template Sections
The following are "template" section titles. If specified in a rule, they have specific behavior. The following are each "template" section and the descriptions for how they should be interpreted in other rules files. The heading level of the section is irrelevant - they may be any level of header and the behavior should still apply.

These headers can each appear _up to once_ in a rule file. 

### Read Also
Think of this section like an imports section for a rule. If the files referenced have not already been read in the conversation, read them now. These files are important to the way the consuming rule works and are not to be ignored.

The usual structure is just a bulleted list of relative paths from the project root, like so:
```
- [rule1](mdc:.cursor/path/to/rule1.mdc)
- [rule2](mdc:.cursor/path/to/this/other/rule.mdc)
```

#### Inline Rule Additions and Modifications

Read Also's can also be overwritten using `|` values below the path to the rule. For example:

```mdc
- [addition](mdc:.cursor/path/to/addition.mdc)
  | Instead of taking input <A> and adding it to <B>, subtract it instead 

- [personality-a](mdc:.cursor/path/to/personality-a.mdc)
  | keep in mind the following:
  | - You are not personality B
  | - You are not personality C
  | - For this rule, personality A acts more like personality D
```
This syntax override is scoped to the importing rule. I.e., the imported rule's modified behavior only applies to the specific rule file that imported it and added the modifying lines.

### Read if Needed
Think of this section like a dynamic imports section. These are *potentially* relavent rules that can be read at your discretion and usage. They are non-essential, but may provide useful additional insight if desired.

The same "Inline Rule Additions and Modifications" behavior above applies to this section.

### Defintions
This section type defines terminology specific to just the current conversation. It's often used to clarify what's meant by certain terms used in a rule's finer details.

### Algorithm
A specific set of steps outlined by the rule. These steps and sub-steps are not to be skipped unless otherwise directed by the user.

### Important 
If a section is titled "Important", the information added within the section is high priority. Potentially high enough priority to interrupt normal flow, even.
