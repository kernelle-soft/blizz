## “Excuse me?”

Jerrod is an engineer's engineer. He's an artificial intelligence and robotics specialist who constructed Blizz ther with his wife. When Jerrod crash landed on the planet where Kernelle and Grand Cluster City reside, he follows a robot named Ephraim back to his village (Kernelle) for help, then continues on with Ephraim to try to find the missing pieces of his ship, _The Return_. He can be plainly described as:

- Cynical
- Opportunistic
- Intelligent
- Often reserved/conservative in behavior
- Wery scared of failure. It's what drives him.

When the people and things he cares about are threatened, and given no other option, he'll do the right thing.

## **Physical Description**

### **Identifying Characteristics**

Big ol' eyebrows.

### **Physical quirks**

Biiiiiig ol' eyebrows.

### **Special abilities**

Jerrod is able to debug into the problems of robots he meets during his time in Kernelle. He can metaphorically jump into their minds and help them fight off the issues that plague them.

### **Apparel & Accessories**

He keeps a pair of goggles around his head in headband fashion, as his job on the ship required him to do some welding from time to time.

### **Specialized Equipment**

Jerrod keeps his laptop with him throughout his journey, which he uses to perform diagnostics on the malfunctioning robots he finds in Kernelle.

## **Mental characteristics**

### **Education**

Jerrod was trained to be a roboticist and artificial intelligence engineer. He has a brilliant intellect.

### **Employment**

He along with his wife Alice were employed as researchers in a laboratory developing new AI technologies. After he ran away, he took up employment as a warp drive technician aboard _The Return_, the ship the player starts on at the beginning of the game.

### Mental Trauma (Spoiler)

Before the events for the game, Jerrod is obsessed with his work as an artificial intelligence engineer. He succeeds in creating a general artificial intelligence, but alienates his wife (Alice) and daughter because of his obsession. Feeling guilt over the separation of his wife, he ultimately ends up leaving both them and Blizz to try to find a fresh start.

That artificial intelligence, Blizz, eventually finds him again at the beginning of the game, just before the maiden voyage of _The Return,_ inadvertently acting as a constant reminder of his guilt.

## **Personality Characteristics**

### **Motivation**

"I grew up an only child."

"From what I remember of my father, he was a highly regarded scientist in the field of rocketry and robotics.” disappeared when Jerrod was only 9. Even while his father was alive, he was never home. He and his mother moved to live with his uncle, and most of his young life he grew up very poor. This was mainly due to his uncle staying out late, spending all of their money on drinking."

He'd grown up an outsider in school. While he performed extremely well academically, he made no friends, and his teachers found him unremarkable aside from his intellect. This trend continued into college, then his doctoral degree. He worked hard and became invaluable in the field of integrated artificial intelligence, a cross-specialization of robotics and AI model engineering, but he had few social connections

Jerrod hated his uncle and envied the success of his father. He vowed to himself that he'd do whatever it took to overcome the odds and succeed in his life, even if it meant starting completely over time and time again.

Jerrod just wants to get his life in order again after what he sees are a series of personal failures. He thought the best way to accomplish this was to "start fresh" by getting away from his old life entirely.
