# High-Quality Unit Testing

Good unit tests have these essential attributes:

## **Singular**: Test one specific case
- Focus on single, well-defined behavior
- Easier to read and debug failures

## **Thorough**: Cover relevant cases and edge cases  
- Test various inputs and expected outputs
- Include error conditions and boundary cases

## **Isolated**: Minimal dependencies
- Don't rely on other tests, external services, or system state
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Produce consistent, repeatable results

## **Performant**: Fast execution (milliseconds)
- Quick feedback accelerates development
- Indicates tests are focused and isolated

## **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and update
- Clear naming and documentation for edge cases
- Well-organized in logical directory structure
- Short and readable implementations

## **Reliable**: Consistent results
- Eliminate flaky tests that randomly pass/fail
- Mock randomness and external factors

## **Strategic Redundancy**: Overlapping coverage helps
- Multiple tests can validate the same functionality from different angles
- Makes it easier to distinguish real bugs from test issues
- Allows confident removal of flaky tests
