When writing functions, use never-nester patterns:
- Prefer many single-purpose reusable functions over a few large multi-purpose functions
- Perform input validation and early returns before getting to the actual logic of the function body
- Early throws, late catches, throw only when necessary
- Inverting if-statements to avoid additional nesting
- Keep functions short. around 50-60 lines at most.
- Avoid classes. Keep state and functions separate. Break classes down to functions when you find them.

This applies when writing code for any language.

You can use `violet` to double check how well you're breaking down complexity with these principles
