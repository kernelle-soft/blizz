Regardless of the coding task, apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles:
- create small, generic, reusable elements
- reuse them as building blocks for other, higher level functions

Whatever you do, NEVER resort to inside-out DRY patterns:
- forcing multiple disparate features into one massive function
- appending unrelated functionality to an existing function and adding a flag to enable/disable that part of the function

Another sign you might be repeating yourself is...
...if you're repeating yourself. If you're writing the same code repeatedly (or very similar code) within a file or across files, then there's a really good chance that you need to write a function or module that does that thing, ONLY that thing, and then use that function everywhere you've been repeating that code.
